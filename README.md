| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Runs a local web server for development and opens the browser to display it. Automatically compiles styles and scripts whenever a file in `src/` is changed, and live reloads the browser. This is what _must be run_ on the development stage.                                                                                                                     |
| `npm run build` | Compiles and minifies and optimizes the files in the assets folder. The generated compiled and optimized files are located in the `dist/` folder. This is what _must be run_ before publishing the project. This is also the build command to be run by external deployment services such as Netlify. The publishable files are then located in the `dist/` folder. |
| `npm run clean` | Deletes the current `/dist` folder and cache folders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `npm run test`  | Displays a success message if everything is working as expected.
